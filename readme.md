# DigiNinja

This is a repository for Trinity Education students to interact with mentors for questions about and grading of modules.

## Content

* Interaction for this module will be for weeks 1, 2, and 4 only as they involve code.

## Asking a question 

### Q & A Workflow

1) Check the week's readme.md file

* You can do this by clicking on the folder in the repository. The readme will automatically display. I.e. https://github.com/TrinityEdu/DigiNinja/tree/master/week-1
* This readme should contain FAQs
* If the Question is answered there, you need not go further.

2) If you have a question, please open a Github issue.

* The mentor will look at the question
* The mentor may chose to interact with the student in the issue by commenting back and forth
* If it looks like a one-off question, the mentor will simply answer it in the issues
* If the question is deemed common and appropriate, the mentor will add the question and answer to the week's readme
* The mentor will finally respond with the answer and close the issue

### How to ask a question related to code
